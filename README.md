Musical Set Theory is a mathematical formalization of various common objects found in the 12-TET tuning system. Although called set theory, musical set theory is more-so an application of group theory and combinatorics to 'pitch classes'. 
From pitch classes (the theoretical variant of a musical note), we are able to formally study objects like scales, musical inversions, transpositions, and various schools of harmony. 

## Misty

Misty is my current project to develop various objects of Musical Set Theory in R. I hope to one day generalize this for uses in practical musical analysis; vectorization of tonal features for neural network composition. Currently, there are two R modules for musical stylometry analysis of .krn files and .midi files, the letter of which is in development.

Currently modeled are the following objects:
- Pitch Continuum
- Scales
- Chords
- Inversions
- Diatonic
